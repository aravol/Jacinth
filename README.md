The Jacinth Entity System is an Entity System wirtten in C#, with primary deisng goals of making a managed implementation, freeform multithreading support, and overall platform stability. For more information on design goals, implementations, and documentation, see the [Jacinth Wiki on GitHub](https://github.com/aravol/Jacinth/wiki).

## Building from source
Currently, Jacinth is written against Visual Studio 2013 Express Edition and does not rely on any assemblies outside the core .NET assemblies. Thus, Jacinth should not require any additional setup beyond cloning, openning `Jacinth.sln`, and building. Any failure of this operation should be [reported as a bug](https://github.com/aravol/Jacinth/issues).
